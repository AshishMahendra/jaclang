# Journey of Building an Zelda-style RPG in JacLang

[Demo Video.webm](https://github.com/Jayanaka-98/py-game-RPG/assets/110921856/1ac069eb-7a07-462f-82fe-a8c1e3481935)

This RPG game is developed using a pre-built base game coded in python which can be found in [here](/home/jayanaka-98/jaclang/examples/rpg_game/python_impl).

The RPG game was then implemented in jaclang in several iterations.

## Setting Up

In order for these implementations to work, the following requirements should be met.

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Jaclang newest available version
- pygame newest available version

## Jaclang Implementation 1 - [_py to jac_](/home/jayanaka-98/jaclang/examples/rpg_game/jac_impl/jac_impl_1)

This is the first version of the Jaclang implementation of the RPG. This source code represents an exact conversion of puthon to jaclang.

### main.py

This file contains the main game code which describes the functionality of the game.

### sprites.py

All in game sprite models are created within this code.

### config.py

Configuration parameters such as windowsize. layer order is stored inthis file.

### map.py

Contains the map of the game which can be changed as required.

- B : Blocks (Walls)
- E : Enemy Spawn Point
- P : Player Spawn Point
