## Features

<!-- ## Integrating Jac into Python Modules

JacLang also provides a seamless way to import Jac into existing Python modules through library functions. Here's an example:

```python
"""CLI for jaclang."""
from jaclang import jac_import

cli = jac_import("cli")
cmds = jac_import("cmds")

cli.cmd_registry = cmds.cmd_reg  # type: ignore
```

In the above code snippet, `cli` and `cmds` are modules that are imported similar to how you'd typically import modules in Python, i.e., `import cli` or `import cmds`.

Below is the actual implementation for Jac's CLI (`cli.jac`) to provide some insight into how Jac code looks:

=== "cli.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jaclang/cli/cli.jac"
    ```
=== "cli_impl.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jaclang/cli/cli_impl.jac"
    ```

That's all you need to get started with JacLang. As you delve into this new language, you'll discover how it beautifully combines the power of Python with a modern and intuitive syntax. Happy coding! -->
