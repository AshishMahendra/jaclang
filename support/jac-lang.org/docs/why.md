# Origin Story

The journey of Jac began with a project called **Jaseci** (1.0, there will be a 2.0 when Jac is done), where Jac found its first realization as an interpreted language. This version of Jac, along with Jaseci, was used to create multiple software stacks a few of which became commercial products in production today. It is loved by the small group of coders who had the opportunity to use it and build with it. This prior Jac/Jaseci stack was interpreted with a separate ecosystem than Python. It also only allowed expressing strictly Data Spatial programs and has a small ecosystem of libraries and tools around it.

Over the past three years, we've learned a lot within this small community. We've understood more about what works and what doesn't, what coders love, and what they need. The fruits of this learning are being reincarnated in this new more ambitious (what I hope to be the final major revised) version of Jac.

The scope of this iteration of Jac is massive, but with discipline and hard work I know it will be realized. It's designed to be a complete programming option for coders everywhere. This Jac marries tethers itself to python much like Typescript is tethered to Javascript, includes a large scope of what we belive to be good ideas to add to python, and incorporates the beloved data spatial programming constructs of the original Jac. We aim to make it accessible to everyone, and to provide a solid, reliable, and enjoyable language for a spectrum of coding needs, from small tinkery prototypes, to massive, complex projects.

## Where Are We today

Jac doesn't have a big backing company (yet), nor a team of paid coders in a company, nor vast resources to fund the project as many successful languages have had. What is guaranteed is the fact that I have a deep reservoir of determination as Jac's creator, and a couple brilliant coders around me who are commited to the vision and excited to see where it goes.

We're very open and welcoming of anyone who might be open to catching the Jac bug. If you're interested in being part of this project and learn more, please feel free to reach out. We'd love to hear from you. We have a journey ahead of us, but with dedication and collaboration, we're confident we can make Jac a beloved part of every coder's toolkit.

## About Me

Hello, I'm Jason Mars, the creator of Jac and it's data spatial programming model. I'm a computer enthusiast, a comp. sci. prof, a tech entrepreneur, an avid coder, a gamer, etc. I hope through some of these roles I've gained insights that can bring value to the creation of Jac to make it useful, practical, and beautiful, oh and FUN!!
