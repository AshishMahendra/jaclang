# Coding Manual

Jac is all of pythons goodness wrapped in a language that gives the coder wings. Lets jump right in!

## Get Jac

Install Jac.

```bash
pip install jaclang
```

Validate Jac works.

```bash
echo "with entry { print('hello world'); } > test.jac; jac load -f test.jac; rm test.jac;"
```

If that command prints `hello world`, Jac is working.

Ok now lets jump into learning Jac!
