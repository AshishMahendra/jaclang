<!-- # Jac Declarations vs. Definitions (compared to Python)

In C++, when writing code, there's often a separation between the **declaration** of a function, variable, or class, and its **definition**. This provides a way to organize code in large projects and enables the use of separate compilation units. Let's understand this concept better.

## 1. C++ Declarations and Definitions

### 1.1 Declarations

In C++, a declaration tells the compiler that a certain entity exists, possibly specifying its type, but it doesn't allocate storage or assign a value to it.

For example, here's a function declaration:

```cpp
void printHello(); // function declaration
```

Here's a variable declaration:

```cpp
extern int x; // variable declaration without definition
```

### 1.2 Definitions

The definition, on the other hand, allocates storage and can also assign values. It's where the actual implementation of a function or method resides.

Function definition:

```cpp
void printHello() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; // function definition
}
```

Variable definition:

```cpp
int x = 10; // variable definition with assignment
```

### 1.3 Separate Compilation

In large C++ projects, the separation of declarations and definitions allows for "separate compilation". This means that source code can be split into multiple files, with declarations typically residing in header files (`.h` or `.hpp`) and definitions in source files (`.cpp`). This aids in modular programming and faster compilation times.

**hello.h**
```cpp
// declaration
void printHello();
```

**hello.cpp**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "hello.h"

// definition
void printHello() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}
```

## 2. Python: A Contrast

Python doesn't have this strict separation between declarations and definitions due to its interpreted nature and dynamic typing. When you define a function or a class in Python, you're both declaring and defining it.

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

| Feature                   | C++                                     | Python                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Declaration & Definition  | Separate (especially in large projects) | Typically Combined                   |
| Type specification        | Mandatory for static types              | Optional (dynamic typing)            |
| Compilation               | Compiled Language                       | Interpreted Language                 |
| Code Organization         | Header and Source Files                 | Modules and Scripts                  |

### Conclusion

C++ provides a clear distinction between declarations and definitions, which aids in code organization, modularity, and separate compilation. On the other hand, Python, being an interpreted and dynamically-typed language, doesn't emphasize this separation, leading to a more concise but potentially less structured codebase in large projects. Both approaches have their merits and cater to different needs and scenarios. -->
