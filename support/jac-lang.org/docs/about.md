# Origin Story

The journey of Jac began with a project called **Jaseci 1.0**, where Jac found its first realization as an interpreted language. This version of Jac, along with Jaseci, was used to create multiple commercial software stacks. It is loved by the small group of coders who had the opportunity to use it and build with it. This prior Jac/Jaseci stack, in its interpreted form, was strictly Data Spatial and has a small ecosystem of libraries and tools around it.

Over the past three years, we've learned a lot. We've understood more about what works and what doesn't, what coders love, and what they need. The fruits of this learning are being reincarnated in this new more ambitious version of Jac.

The scope of this iteration of Jac is massive, but with discipline and hard work I know it will be realized. It's designed to be a complete programming option for coders everywhere. This Jac marries the greatness of python's design, a number of additional good ideas, and the  beloved features and data spatial programming of the original Jac. We aim to make it accessible to everyone, and to provide a solid, reliable, and enjoyable language for a spectrum of coding needs, from small scripts to massive, complex projects.

## Where Are We today

Jac doesn't have a big backing company (yet), or a team of coders working under me, or vast resources to fund this project like many successful languages have had. What I do have is a deep reservoir of determination and few brilliant coders around me who are commited to the vision and excited to see where it goes.

We're very open and welcoming of anyone who might be open to catch the Jac bug. If you're interested in being part of this ambitious project, please feel free to reach out. We'd love to hear from you. We have a journey ahead of us, but with dedication and collaboration, we're confident we can make Jac a beloved part of every coder's toolkit.

## About Me

Hello, I'm Jason Mars, the creator of Jac and it's data spatial programming model. I'm a computer enthusiast, a comp. sci. prof, a tech entrepreneur, an avid coder, a gamer, etc. I believe through some of these roles I've gained insights I can bring to bear on the creation of Jac to make it useful, practical, and beautiful, oh and FUN!!
