# Welcome to Jac

**Jac** is a new programming language that seamlessly transpiles to Python, combining the power and flexibility of Python's ecosystem and 'pythonic' coding style with a unique 'jactastic' approach to programming. It draws inspiration from a variety of programming languages to improve upon Python to create an engaging, productive, and intuitive coding experience, giving the coder all of python's power, plus superpowers.

Beyond improvements that can be found in other languages such as strong typing and type checking built into the language, the elvis an null safe operators, and an innovative take on the pipe forward operation, Jac includes what may prove to be a monumental advancement in programming languages called the **Data Spatial Programming Model**. Just as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) brought a higher level of abstraction to C and Fortran's functions offered a new way to manage assembly code, Jac introduces Data Spatial Programming constructs expanding on the concept of OOP. This new model is a higher-level abstraction that lets programmers rethink how they interact with data structures, and enable new ways of thinking and being productive.

That being said, Jac was meticulously designed to provide a seamless gradient of expressibility allowing coders to code in a familiar pythonic style, and use as much or as little data spatial semantics as they'd like.

## A Love Letter to Python, and Beyond

Jac's existence is a tribute to the world of programming, computers, and code. It captures the spirit of what makes coding a joyful experience while expanding upon the foundation laid by the beloved language - Python. At its core, Jac is a love letter to Python and modern coding. It inherits the clean syntax, flexibility, and broad applicability that makes Python one of the most popular programming languages in the world. However, Jac is designed to give us coders superpowers.

## A Home for the Joy of Coding

The goal of Jac is to serve as a home home language for the joy of coding. Jac's mission is to be super python today, but there's nothing fundamentally preventing Jac from targeting C/C++ ecosystems via generating MLIR, or Java's ecosystem targeting the JVM. Webassembly comes for free really with both python and C/C++ already fully compatible. I digress.

Jac is built for us. It is a language that I wanted to use and one that I believe you will want to use too. We are looking forward to seeing what you will create with Jac, and how you will add to its evolving story.

Join us on this exciting journey. Let's make code art with Jac.
